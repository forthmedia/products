# products
This project uses an ES6 JavaScript Promise (src/js/Scripts.js) to consume and then render a products page, from JSON. There is a JavaScript class (src/js/Modal.js) which manages a popup carousel photo gallery.

There is a GulpFile which builds the project by Babel compiling ES6, then combines and minifies JS and CSS for distribution.
