# products
This project uses an ES6 JavaScript Promise (src/js/Scripts.js) to consume and then render a products page, from JSON. There is a JavaScript class (src/js/Modal.js) which manages a popup carousel photo gallery.

There is a GulpFile to build the project by Babel transpiling ES6, then combining and minifying JS and CSS for distribution.

The products page has responsive column breaks for desktop, pad and mobile devices.
